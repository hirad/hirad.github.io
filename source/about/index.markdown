I am an electrical engineer-turned salesman-turned software developer-turned entrepreneur. (And my name is pronounced "Hee-Rod").

I'm a programmer+entrepreneur (sorry, I hate that word, too) by day. When I'm not travelling, I practice Aikido under a [world-renowned instructor](http://aikidoburnaby.com/robert-mustard-sensei/) - an experience that has shaped how I view almost every struggle in my life and how I react to it. In addition to that, I'm a big admirer of people like [Tynan](www.tynan.com), [Tim Ferris](http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/) and [Derek Sivers](www.sivers.org). Seriously do yourself a favour and check them out.

A Persian poet once said: "Seek knowledge from cradle to the grave." This site is probably going to be a log of my attempts to follow that advice.
