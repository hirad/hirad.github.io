I am an engineer-turned salesman-turned software developer-turned entrepreneur. (And my name is pronounced "Hee-Rod").

I try to travel a lot. When I'm not doing that, I practice Aikido under a [world-renowned instructor](http://aikidoburnaby.com/robert-mustard-sensei/) - an experience that has shaped how I view almost every struggle in my life and how I react to it. My greatest joy is gaining new insights about the way the world is. Some of those insights are more useful than others.

A Persian poet once said: "Seek knowledge from cradle to the grave." This site is probably going to be a log of my attempts to follow that advice.

I'm on Twitter: [@theHirad](https://twitter.com/theHirad).
