It seems pretty undeniable that Borat is deeply racist, and some of the techniques used in the movie to fool people into playing the butt of the joke is downright bullying. (See Zeynep Tufekci&amp;rsquo;s thread &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1320392228804694017?s=20&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, Borat also targets the approved-for-mocking segments of western society, so the people who are typically up in arms about endemic racism are not only silent but are cheering for it. It turns out, shitting on an ethnicity you can barely pronounce is a small price for catching Rudy Giuliani with his hand in his pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a good measure of knowing where true power lies in society. If you think democracy is in danger because of right wing nuts or white supremacists, ask yourself who is more likely to pay a price for comedy: a comedian who mocks poor, low-education, white westerners and politicians who pander to them, or one that would similarly mocks, say, blacks or hispanics? Similarly, what kind of stereotyping would we accept as &amp;ldquo;just parody&amp;rdquo; and which ones would prompt widespread condemnation in newspapers of record?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, for one, think Borat is racist, and that it&amp;rsquo;s OK. The answer to offensive speech is always more speech, not censoring it or calling for its cancellation or trying to outlaw it with piddling &amp;ldquo;hate speech&amp;rdquo; laws. Some speech will always cause someone&amp;rsquo;s feelings from being hurt. It&amp;rsquo;s fine.

I was about 13 years old, and something had broken with my computer, which I needed to play games. My teacher at the time suggested I read a book on how to fix computers myself. When I entered the computer books section of Chapters, my mind was blown by the sheer number of books. Something clicked in my head and I thought: &amp;ldquo;I need to read all of these!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that point on, I had an insatiable appetite for learning. The only exception to this were my university years – nothing can stifle a desire to learn like post-secondary education. I always imagined that given infinite resources and the ability to spend my time any way I wanted, I would just spend it learning and reading as much as I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That notion is now deeply ingrained in my mind. But with age, I&amp;rsquo;m realizing how misguided it is. The bottleneck to learning is not just time to read. It is time to apply. True learning is impossible without meaningful application. We don&amp;rsquo;t learn through words but through all the senses. As the saying goes, &amp;ldquo;the rudder only works when the ship is moving&amp;rdquo; and building a large ship but never leaving port is simply a wasted investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always longed for the day when I can finally do nothing but learn. It&amp;rsquo;s easy for us to construct visions of an ideal future where we&amp;rsquo;ll be happier than now, and boundless time to read was (and is) a huge part of my utopian vision. But these visions are like dreams that don&amp;rsquo;t make sense upon a second inspection, and if we cling to them for too long or believe them too much, we&amp;rsquo;ll be unhappy when they (the impossible) are not realized. And if we do manage to achieve them, we&amp;rsquo;ll find that while all the conditions of our dreams are met, the envisioned happiness is not to be found, and we&amp;rsquo;ll repeat the cycle with a new vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this means that the range of topics and skills that I can truly learn and apply is much more limited than what I imagined in my head. It also means that I&amp;rsquo;m already living the life that I always wanted as much as is practical. If I was retired, the dials might get slightly tweaked and I may have a few extra hours per week to learn something or apply it.

How can a manager ensure that his business can maintain healthy profit margins for extended periods of time without having those profits eroded by competition? How can an investor identify companies likely to generate healthy returns on capital?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these questions interest you, Hamilton Helmer&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.ca/7-Powers-Foundations-Business-Strategy/dp/0998116319&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;7 Powers: The Foundations of Business Strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; might be the most important book you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of. Unlike most business books, its 210 pages are packed with valuable insight and clear explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a book on business strategy, and it addresses the topic at a foundational level. It aims to provide the reader with a &amp;ldquo;strategy compass&amp;rdquo;. For the manager of a business operation the strategy compass is a guide on navigating the trials of the business world to arrive (with some luck) at an attractive strategic position such that the business can command healthy profit margins and yet be protected from the arbitraging effect of competition. For the investor, the strategy compass provides a means of identifying strong and high-potential businesses that may not have been discovered yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff Bezos famously said &amp;ldquo;your margin is my opportunity&amp;rdquo;. This quote captures the dilemma for everyone who operates a business. A new venture starts by identifying a need for its customer base that has not been met. A solution is developed for this need and the business is off to a great start. Soon enough, however, others take notice and copycats emerge. They also want a piece of the pie, and what better way to compete with the pioneer than by undercutting their prices? Before long, the attractive profits enjoyed by the pioneering venture have been eroded by competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet some businesses are immune from this effect. In spite of years of developing competitive (or superior) technologies, AMD could never dethrone Intel as the dominant supplier of chips for PCs. What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between businesses that are immune to competition and those that are not? Helmer&amp;rsquo;s answer is that there are seven strategic positions (powers) that allow businesses to command high profits and keep them protected from competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are the seven powers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network effects&lt;/strong&gt;: Any product that improves as more people use it benefits from network effects. Facebook is the most uniquitous example of this. A social network is only as good as the friends you have on it. Facebook established itself as the dominant social network. This position was so powerful that in 2011, even $200B Google couldn&amp;rsquo;t challenge Facebook&amp;rsquo;s dominance with its Google+ offering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale economies&lt;/strong&gt;: Some products cost too much unless they&amp;rsquo;re made for a sufficiently large number of customers, such that the cost per each customer comes down. Microprocessors are a perfect example. They&amp;rsquo;re incredibly expensive to develop. Once Intel raced ahead in its market size, it became increasingly difficult for AMD to challenge them because Intel could outcompete AMD by spreading its costs across the larger customer base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switching costs&lt;/strong&gt;: Some products make it incredibly difficult for customers to switch once they have adopted the product. For example, a complicated piece of entreprise software requires expensive installation process. Then the workforce needs to be trained on the new software. Then the software needs to be supported on an ongoing basis. Each of these phases makes it less likely that the customer will consider an alternative vendor in the future. High installation costs are a deterrent. The need to re-train the workforce is another deterrent, and the personal relationships forged with the personnel of the existing vendor are yet another deterrent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counter-positioning&lt;/strong&gt;: Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to challenge an incumbent by offering a unique angle on an existing product. The example Helmer provides is Vanguard. Its founder was thought insane by existing active money managers who charged large fees for their management services. Vanguard offered index funds with low fees and no active management. Even once the new approach proved popular and profitable, the incumbents had an institutional aversion to embracing it because it meant canibalizing their existing profitable businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Branding&lt;/strong&gt;: This one is pretty obvious. Brands are incredibly powerful and command loyalty from their base. However, they&amp;rsquo;re also one of the most elusive power types because they require persistent investment over a long period of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cornered resource&lt;/strong&gt;: A company can sustain high profit margins if it has exclusive control over a valuable resource. Here, &amp;ldquo;resource&amp;rdquo; can refer to anything from patents (as in the case of pharmaceuticals) to talent (as was the case of Pixar&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;brain trust&amp;rdquo; consisting of Ed Catmull, John Lasseter, and Steve Jobs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process power&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the most rare of the powers. A company can develop a process that delivers superior results that cannot be copied by others. Helmer provides the example of the Toyota Production System. The company spent decades trying to optimize its manufacturing. When it became clear that Toyota was building superior cars, it even allowed staff from GM to observe its factories and question its staff. Still, GM could not reproduce Toyota&amp;rsquo;s success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These are the seven powers. Companies that don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy at least one of these powers are bound to fall into a race-to-the-bottom as competitors erode their profit margins. For the interested reader, Helmer also shows mathematically the impact of each power type on the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these powers include a benefit enjoyed by the winning business. Equally crucially, they create a barrier that makes it undesirable for others to compete with the winning business. This combination of benefit and barrier is what leads to power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helmer calls these the &amp;ldquo;strategy statics&amp;rdquo;. These are desirable destinations for any business. How to reach these destinations is what Helmer calls &amp;ldquo;strategy dynamics&amp;rdquo;. These are my main takeaways on dynamics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategy is not made in a vaccum, it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/1987/07/crafting-strategy&quot;&gt;crafted&lt;/a&gt;. As Helmer puts it in the book, &amp;ldquo;the rudder only works when the ship is moving&amp;rdquo;. Nobody can invent a winning strategy in isolation. It requires the business leaders to be intimately familiar with every aspect of their business and their market. They need to keep their eyes on the seven destinations above and use their feel of their organizational capability and the market landscape to navigate to those destinations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The first cause of every Power is invention &amp;hellip; of product, process, business model, or brand.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The opportunity for invention arises out of external conditions. When these are ripe, the company uses its existing resources and capabilities to invent in any of the axes specified above to bring compelling value to market - value that is not currently offered by incumbents. Without the right combination of external conditions and invention, power can&amp;rsquo;t be achieved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An invention that brings compelling value to market, creates or significantly expands the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are three ways to bring compelling value to market:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capabilities-led. The company uses its capabilities to invent. The risk here is that there may not be a market for the invention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer-led. The company starts from the needs of the customers to invent. The risk here is that it may not have the right capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competitor-led. Sometimes a competitor has successfully brought a compelling product to market but the company can invent a superior or adjacent product that expands the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Helmer points out that each of the seven powers need to be achieved in different phases of the company lifecycle. It does not make sense, for example, to invest heavily in the branding of a fledgling startup. Similarly, the time to achieve sufficient market share is during the early growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s a quick summary of Helmer&amp;rsquo;s strategy compass. I highly recommend you read the book if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in business strategy. I also recommend reading Henry Mintzberg&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/1987/07/crafting-strategy&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Crafting Strategy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; article that Helmer references. The notion that strategy is not designed but crafted rejects some approaches to strategy where managers who are distant from the business can get in a room and think their way to a strategy. It highlights the fact that ultimately, strategy comes down to judgement, which in turn comes down to an intimate familiarity with every facet of the organization, the customer base, and the industry. With this knowledge, good judgement, and a little luck, the manager can use Helmer&amp;rsquo;s strategy compass to navigate the business to one of the desirable destinations above.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="essays" /><summary type="html">Why can some businesses generate vast amounts of profits while others can&amp;rsquo;t, even with comparable products and services?

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s prediction relates to the airlines, and it&amp;rsquo;s closely related to the previous &lt;a href=&quot;http://hirad.ca/essays/2020/05/02/pandemic-predictions-part-2.html&quot;&gt;prediction around commercial real estate&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, I wanted to include this in that post, but I decided to dig for some data to paint a fuller picture. I failed on that front. If you&amp;rsquo;re good at business/industry analysis and you read this, I have a few asks for you at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the prediction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous post, I noted that I expect more and more workplaces to divest of their real estate and for remote work to become much more prevalent. Related to that, I foresee business travel to see a permanent reduction as a result of a much more widely-adopted remote work cultures. I can think of three types of business travel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work that requires physical presence in a certain location. For example, a large engineering company may land a construction project far from their HQ and will need to send staff back and forth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work that is more effective in-person. I think this is primarily sales. Building rapport with potential customers is much more effective in person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other. Companies often make people travel due to geographically-constrained workplaces, even though the nature of the work doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; being co-located.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I believe the last category, in the long run, will nearly vanish, as remote work becomes widely adopted and cost savings of less travel become possible and attractive. This will reduce demand for air travel from business customers. Demand will be further reduced in the second category as well - while some work is better done in person, the additional risk factor will move that cutoff line higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where having some data could&amp;rsquo;ve been useful. Given the above predictions, I would like to know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What portion of annual airline revenues come from business travellers and in which sectors?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What portion of annual airline &lt;em&gt;profits&lt;/em&gt; come from business travellers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which airlines had the majority of their revenues and profits from business customers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In which routes do business travel revenues dominate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Given the above information, one could make some further predictions about the airline industry in general. I &lt;em&gt;suspect&lt;/em&gt; that business travellers are less cost conscious than leisure travellers, and that business travellers are less likely to travel on discount airlines than on higher-end airlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a long timeline, I don&amp;rsquo;t think leisure travel will see much permanent reduction in demand. We&amp;rsquo;re not out of the woods yet with COVID19, and even cruise liners are seeing sales recover already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, without more data, these predictions can&amp;rsquo;t say much about how the supply side may change due to the predicted changes in demand.

Related to that, I foresee business travel to see a permanent reduction as a result of a much more widely-adopted remote work cultures. I can think of three types of business travel: Work that requires physical presence in a certain location. For example, a large engineering company may land a construction project far from their HQ and will need to send staff back and forth. Work that is more effective in-person.

&lt;!-- more --&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a living post - I will update it as I think this through more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think commercial real estate is going to see a permanent drop in demand and therefore in prices. This does not hold true for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; types of commercial real estate, but it does hold true for many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Reasoning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An anecdote: my company recently got acquired by a bank. When we joined them, just a few months ago, people steeped in bank culture found the idea of remote work not only alien, but somewhat disturbing. On the other hand, walking 20-30 minutes between multiple towers in downtown Toronto for a meeting is something they don&amp;rsquo;t bat an eye at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, there is no legimate reason why business needs to be conducted that way - specially in technology-focused businesses. This was not a failure of capability, as much as it was a failure of culture. Coronavirus has shattered that culture. Everyone at those offices is now working from home. This is not to say that everyone &lt;em&gt;likes&lt;/em&gt; working from home right now (I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed having children is a particular impediment in enjoying WFH). But they&amp;rsquo;ve all been forced into a mandatory two-month-long trial, which is likely to continue. It&amp;rsquo;s a similar story across all sorts of businesses, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we&amp;rsquo;re through this pandemic, I expect everyone to return to business-as-usual. But I expect some key lessons will be learned from this about the benefits of remote work in cultures that would otherwise never imagine it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the pandemic is over, more workplaces will be offering remote work options for more types of roles. With this, lack of remote work options will become an impediment to hiring top talent, as it already has for tech hires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the pandemic is over, many workplaces will be reviewing how much they got done with everyone working from home, and they&amp;rsquo;ll be eyeing the expense line on their cash flows as a top candidate for cost-cutting. Even workplaces that are primarily office-based may need a reduced capacity as some portion of their workforce can work remotely at any given time. Large corporations that own their own real estate may see it as less essential and will be more likely to divest, increasing supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture shifts take time to be ingrained, but the pandemic has massively accelerated the shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of office space, many businesses will be innovating with a lower reliance on expensive, prime real estate. Cloud kitchens, for example, were a trend pre-pandemic, and that will only continue. If Amazon had habituated us to buy things online and get them a few days later, pandemic will take this to the next level, with delivery of all essentials becoming not just a preference, but a matter of safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One big impediment to remote work is legal. When I bought my apartment, I had to commute for approx. 45 minutes to a lawyer&amp;rsquo;s office, sign a few documents in front of her (which took 5 minutes), then commute back for 45 minutes. This was and is infuriarting and nobody should accept it as &amp;lsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;okay&amp;rsquo;. We have better ways, and the pandemic has also set the stage for updating our legal frameworks to be more remote-friendly – changes that would otherwise move at a glacial pace. For now, many of these changes are poised as temporary measures, but that&amp;rsquo;s how it&amp;rsquo;ll start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these factors will conspire to decrease the demand in commercial real estate. You&amp;rsquo;ve heard about the obvious winners in the current circumstance: remote communication tools, e-commerce, to name a few. This is the flipside of that coin - commercial real estate is the obvious loser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to be spending less time in wasteful commutes, and more time getting shit done. We&amp;rsquo;ll be happier, and in the very long term, we may even have more beautiful, less car-focused, more environmentally-friendly, and more decentralized cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The impact of this change on the urban landscape is another very interesting thread - to be pulled on in another post perhaps.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all types of commercial real estate will see this drop in demand, of course. As we spend more time in our homes, and more time away from a &amp;ldquo;downtown core&amp;rdquo;, we&amp;rsquo;ll need increasingly better infrastructure to serve our needs where we are. Many services that are currently concentrated in business districts will be downsized and spread more evenly across the urban landscape, closer to where people live.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="essays" /><summary type="html">In the previous post, I talked about when we might go back to normal.

So here&amp;rsquo;s how I think we need to approach the answer, based on my readings so far. The TL;DR is &amp;ldquo;not soon&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to understand why this virus is problematic. It&amp;rsquo;s not just that the disease is so bad. Even though it is bad, we can treat most people who get it. The main issue is that it&amp;rsquo;s spreading so fast, and that means overwhelming the healthcare system. Medicine may &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; how to help someone, but if there are no doctors or hospital beds or other equipment to deliver the treatment, the knowledge does us no good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the main risk is overloading the health care system. Therefore, &amp;ldquo;when will we go back to normal&amp;rdquo; is really asking &amp;ldquo;when can we do everything we used to do, without running the risk of overloading the health care system?&amp;rdquo;. That question in turn is really asking &amp;ldquo;when will we be confident there won&amp;rsquo;t be a surge of infections from our day-to-day activities?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be confident of that there won&amp;rsquo;t be a surge, one of the following must be true:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a vaccine. This is, in the best case, 1.5-2 years out. Additionally, once a vaccine exists, it must be manufactured in sufficiently large quantities. Likely, it&amp;rsquo;ll have gradual rollout, and that will take time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have herd immunity. This is also either very slow (order of years) or very catastrophic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a treatment. A vaccine is not strictly neccessary, if we can find treatments that won&amp;rsquo;t require prolonged, intense hospitalizations for the most-affected patients. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read anything about this, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how likely it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have pervasive and fast testing. Having this requires competent planning and execution. We seem to be in a pretty good place on that front in Canada and specially in BC. However, this path also requires access to equipment/manufacturing capacity, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if we can get that in Canada.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, barring some miraculous breakthrough, achieving any of these solutions at a sufficiently large scale is an effort in the order of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming we have one of these options available, we must subtract from this asset any liability that will put its gains at risk. For example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will individuals who have had the virus be able to get sick from it again? (The fact that we don&amp;rsquo;t know this six months later should give a sense of the timeline before we can get a handle on it.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will the Canadian government buckle under some political pressure &amp;amp; open the border with the USA? If that happens, we can have American pee in our pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will we allow foreign travel/tourism? Again, if we&amp;rsquo;re doing well locally, but we don&amp;rsquo;t have closed borders, we can be inviting the virus from abroad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will the &amp;ldquo;solution&amp;rdquo; we come up with be optional or mandatory? If we find a vaccine tomorrow, how many hicks will refuse to vaccinate to avoid autism, for example? If we do pervasive testing, can some people opt-out and yet go about their day?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All of this is to say, I doubt we&amp;rsquo;re going back to normal any time soon, not for years - until we have a vaccine and/or herd immunity. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we&amp;rsquo;ll be in lockdown or staying home the whole time. I think the most likely scenario – the option that seems most immediately available – is that we will cycle through periods of lockdown and relaxing restrictions. We won&amp;rsquo;t really flatten the curve, we&amp;rsquo;ll break it down into several smaller curves over a longer time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things, like international travel or large-crowd events (concerts, sports), will be the last to make a come back. Other activities can come back more quickly. We may be able to hang out in small groups. Some public spaces may be able to open with some restrictions (like mandatory masks). Some workplaces may be able to operate in-person again (should they still want to). And I sure hope BC will open its provincial parks again. But we should not hope to go back to living the way we used to any time soon. In fact, we probably never will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long period of living under restrictions will re-shape society. We will find new ways of doing the things we did before, and we may find that the new ways are, in some cases, not so bad. For example, more people will work from home permanently. This will have widespread ramifications for the economy. I &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; to follow up with additional posts on how I think this situation will affect different industries. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Like everyone else, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a number of conversation in the last few weeks around the question of &amp;ldquo;when will we go back to normal?&amp;rdquo;.

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Lao Tzu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say judging people is bad. I’m not sure I agree. Regardless, we all do it anyway. I want to continuously improve my heuristics to make good judgements of people. Good heuristics are rare, but I have one that’s fairly reliable that I’m going to share with you here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- More --&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Last year, I attended a ten day meditation retreat. There was one specific individual at this retreat who stood out. He was an “old student”, which means he had done at least one ten-day course before. While the attendees were socializing at the meditation centre before the beginning of the course and before Noble Silence was to be observed, he was sitting quietly in a corner. If someone tried to speak to him, he would turn his head toward them extremely slowly, give the shortest possible answer, and go back to being quiet. In addition to his behaviour, he also stood out because of his appearance. He was wearing what looked like rags — what you might expect to see on a beggar on an Indian street. Except it didn’t look authentic. The rags were quite nice. It was what you might expect to see from a well-off white guy impersonating a poor Indian beggar. He also walked barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time I noticed him was on the last day of the retreat. For ten days, we had all been silent. On the last day, Noble Silence ended and people started chattering again. However, talking was still disallowed in the main meditation hall. At one point, while some people were talking in the hallway, I was in the meditation hall, trying to practice. This individual was also there, sitting a few rows in front of me. In between us, two people started talking. The meditation hall was already not so quiet, considering that the chatter from the hallway was easily audible. The additional noise from the two talkers inside the hall was too much for this individual to bear. He turned around and gave the two talkers an angry “SSSSHHHHH!!!”. I’ll never forget the look of rage on his face. Ten days of working on increasing compassion had evaporated in an instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This individual, in my mind, represents the quintessential “peacock” in a community. He went to great lengths to put on appearances about his devotion to the practice, but at the end of the day, he exhibited none of the skill. Peacocks exist in every walk of life, and observing many of them has led me to this heuristic: I am instantly suspicious of people who are putting on excessive appearances. These appearances can be visual (eg. clothing) or behavioural (eg. acting overly sensitive to certain subjects) or verbal (eg. the proverbial “blowing of one’s own trumpet”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this peacocking is to elevate one’s status in a community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peacocks thrive in environments where the authenticity of status signals are hard to gauge. In the tech community, peacocking is difficult. You can’t fool people into thinking you’re a good engineer by putting on thicker glasses and lowering your social skills. At the end of the day, you’ll have to speak knowledgeably and write good code. Nassim Taleb has pointed out in &lt;em&gt;Skin In The Game&lt;/em&gt;, the ultimate authentic signal is courage: a display of courage &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; proof of its true existence. Most signals that people send each other don’t have this high of a signal-to-substance ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, zouk and aikido communities that I’m part of are rife with peacocks. In zouk, these people gravitate toward a style of dance that (they think) does not require rigorous work on fundamentals. They might state that feeling is more important than technique. They might wear genie pants to look like time-travelling hippies who escaped their commune in the ’60s. The teachers they idolize look this way, so they copy the appearance. Those teachers, however, are often highly skilled, but where their technique might take years of hard practice to copy, their outward appearance can be copied very quickly and used as a status signal in the community. These people often don’t have a regular teacher that they train under, but they attend all the big events and sometimes take private lessons, which they use as an opportunity to &amp;ldquo;socialize&amp;rdquo; with well-known teachers and tell their friends about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In aikido, the story is not so different. Strength and stamina are often used to signal skill in aikido where there is none. Unnecessarily long or elaborate demonstrations are used to impress untrained spectators or equally unskilled peers. The trained eye can see that every technique in these demonstrations is performed with the most egregious mistakes. Often, similar to the zouk peacocks, the aikido peacocks will attend seminars with famous teachers with no attention whatever to the lessons being taught. They love collecting a large catalogue of famous teachers who they can claim they’ve trained under. They might collect photos with these teachers, in which they’ll pose like thugs with a stern face and clenched fists to make sure they look tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to emphasize that merely sending these signals by itself is not evidence of anything wrong. Strength and stamina are not bad things. Attending lots of seminars is not a bad thing. Looking like a hippie&amp;hellip; well, ok, that one’s unforgivable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue with peacocks is not just that they send these signals. It’s that they’re signalling a lie. They want you to believe they possess substance that they simply don’t. Substance is hard to gauge, but we notice others’ signals right away. But here’s the thing about people with substance: they are in no rush and they can wait for you to see theirs. They’re confident and reassured. Peacocks are neither of these things. So when I see someone sending signals a little too loudly, I think the lady doth protest too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heuristics are not perfect, and I try to give people a chance even when my peacock radar is going off. But I’ve often been right about peacocks, and whatever any individual’s merits may be, peacocking is at the very least a sign of disingenuity and perhaps dishonesty. In communities where they can thrive, peacocks will eventually become teachers or leaders, and they will mislead entire contingents of beginners who don’t know any better about choosing who to follow. That is the biggest harm of the peacock.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">When the great Tao is forgotten, goodness and piety appear.

In addition to his behaviour, he also stood out because of his appearance. He was wearing what looked like rags — what you might expect to see on a beggar on an Indian street. Except it didn’t look authentic. The rags were quite nice. It was what you might expect to see from a well-off white guy impersonating a poor Indian beggar. He also walked barefoot. The next time I noticed him was on the last day of the retreat. For ten days, we had all been silent. On the last day, Noble Silence ended and people started chattering again. However, talking was still disallowed in the main meditation hall. At one point, while some people were talking in the hallway, I was in the meditation hall, trying to practice. This individual was also there, sitting a few rows in front of me. In between us, two people started talking. The meditation hall was already not so quiet, considering that the chatter from the hallway was easily audible. The additional noise from the two talkers inside the hall was too much for this individual to bear. He turned around and gave the two talkers an angry “SSSSHHHHH!!!”. I’ll never forget the look of rage on his face. Ten days of working on increasing compassion had evaporated in an instance. This individual, in my mind, represents the quintessential “peacock” in a community. He went to great lengths to put on appearances about his devotion to the practice, but at the end of the day, he exhibited none of the skill. Peacocks exist in every walk of life, and observing many of them has led me to this heuristic: I am instantly suspicious of people who are putting on excessive appearances. These appearances can be visual (eg. clothing) or behavioural (eg. acting overly sensitive to certain subjects) or verbal (eg. the proverbial “blowing of one’s own trumpet”). The purpose of this peacocking is to elevate one’s status in a community. Peacocks thrive in environments where the authenticity of status signals are hard to gauge. In the tech community, peacocking is difficult. You can’t fool people into thinking you’re a good engineer by putting on thicker glasses and lowering your social skills. At the end of the day, you’ll have to speak knowledgeably and write good code. Nassim Taleb has pointed out in Skin In The Game, the ultimate authentic signal is courage: a display of courage is proof of its true existence. Most signals that people send each other don’t have this high of a signal-to-substance ratio. For example, zouk and aikido communities that I’m part of are rife with peacocks. In zouk, these people gravitate toward a style of dance that (they think) does not require rigorous work on fundamentals. They might state that feeling is more important than technique. They might wear genie pants to look like time-travelling hippies who escaped their commune in the ’60s. The teachers they idolize look this way, so they copy the appearance. Those teachers, however, are often highly skilled, but where their technique might take years of hard practice to copy, their outward appearance can be copied very quickly and used as a status signal in the community. These people often don’t have a regular teacher that they train under, but they attend all the big events and sometimes take private lessons, which they use as an opportunity to &amp;ldquo;socialize&amp;rdquo; with well-known teachers and tell their friends about it. In aikido, the story is not so different. Strength and stamina are often used to signal skill in aikido where there is none. Unnecessarily long or elaborate demonstrations are used to impress untrained spectators or equally unskilled peers. The trained eye can see that every technique in these demonstrations is performed with the most egregious mistakes. Often, similar to the zouk peacocks, the aikido peacocks will attend seminars with famous teachers with no attention whatever to the lessons being taught. They love collecting a large catalogue of famous teachers who they can claim they’ve trained under. They might collect photos with these teachers, in which they’ll pose like thugs with a stern face and clenched fists to make sure they look tough. It’s important to emphasize that merely sending these signals by itself is not evidence of anything wrong. Strength and stamina are not bad things. Attending lots of seminars is not a bad thing. Looking like a hippie&amp;hellip; well, ok, that one’s unforgivable. The issue with peacocks is not just that they send these signals. It’s that they’re signalling a lie. They want you to believe they possess substance that they simply don’t. Substance is hard to gauge, but we notice others’ signals right away. But here’s the thing about people with substance: they are in no rush and they can wait for you to see theirs. They’re confident and reassured. Peacocks are neither of these things. So when I see someone sending signals a little too loudly, I think the lady doth protest too much. Heuristics are not perfect, and I try to give people a chance even when my peacock radar is going off. But I’ve often been right about peacocks, and whatever any individual’s merits may be, peacocking is at the very least a sign of disingenuity and perhaps dishonesty. In communities where they can thrive, peacocks will eventually become teachers or leaders, and they will mislead entire contingents of beginners who don’t know any better about choosing who to follow. That is the biggest harm of the peacock.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Goodbye, Old Politics</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/essays/2018/10/07/goodbye.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Goodbye, Old Politics" /><published>2018-10-07T00:48:32+01:00</published><updated>2018-10-07T00:48:32+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/essays/2018/10/07/goodbye</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/essays/2018/10/07/goodbye.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Almost everything here is my takeaway from ideas put forth by Ben Thompson from &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com&quot;&gt;Stratechery&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://exponent.fm&quot;&gt;Exponent podcast&lt;/a&gt;, being rehashed to cement my own understanding&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world has changed a lot since 90s. Even though I&amp;rsquo;m only 30, I&amp;rsquo;m old enough to remember a time when the world looked very different. I remember fax machines and answering machines that recorded messages on tape. I remember the first computers that grade-school-me would see as nothing more than glorified game consoles. I remember when you had be very mindful of your time on the internet because your ISP was charging you by the kilobyte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- More --&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the 90s and early 2000s, you had broadcast media with fixed schedules that you had to adapt yourself to, produced by a few big national players; you had big box stores that you&amp;rsquo;d drive to in order to purchase consumer packaged goods from brands that had been established for upwards of a century; and you had a handful of news sources that would tell you more or less the same thing, possibly with a slightly different slant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t have those things anymore. If we do, they&amp;rsquo;re merely a shadow of their old selves, clinging to dear life until their last remnants die with the last generation that doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how to use the internet. Why did these things go away?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central theme is that the internet allowed a shift from a world where the winners controlled the supply, to a world where the winners control demand. The few media companies that controlled the narrative surrounding the news before the internet didn&amp;rsquo;t do so because theirs was the only narrative people wanted to read or hear. They did so because they owned printing presses and trucks and it was far too expensive for anybody else to compete with them. The consumer packaged goods that you would buy from the likes of, say, Gillette weren&amp;rsquo;t there because they were the best product on the market, they were there because the manufacturers had the best deals with the big box retailers and could effectively block anyone else from entering the market. Shelf space was limited and they controlled it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; try to get your own competing products built with a higher quality or a lower price, but good luck to you for getting it to the market. Similarly, your cable or phone company was not entrenched thanks to consumer choice but because they owned precious limited infrastructure that nobody else could use, so consumers had no choice but to accept their poor service at outrageous prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this was even true of the technology companies of the 80s and 90s. Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s dominance was built around it being difficult for consumers to be able to use the tools they wanted on any platform other than Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet changed all of this. It made distribution essentially free, so all of these industries that were predicated on monopolized distribution channels began to lose their grip. In the case of Microsoft, for example, the tools people really wanted were now one layer of abstraction above the chokepoint – you can access the information on the internet through any device regardless of whether it runs Windows or not. For the consumer packaged goods industry, online distribution meant that they were now on a level playing field with &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; who could produce the same product at them and deliver them to the consumers' homes. Shelf space was unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of the last decade has been one of distribution monopolies being sidelined by a new world where their strengths are no longer competitive. What they&amp;rsquo;ve been replaced by are new monopolies. These are monopolies of demand, such as Facebook, Google, or Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don&amp;rsquo;t use Facebook, Google, or Amazon because they have to. In fact, you and I are more than free to build and market our own competing products/services to all three (in part courtesy of Amazon and Google services) and market them directly to the same consumers who use them. But it won&amp;rsquo;t make a difference. People won&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to use our service, they&amp;rsquo;ll &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to use theirs because they have network effects. You can build an alternative search engine (&lt;a href=&quot;www.bing.com&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ca.search.yahoo.com&quot;&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;www.duckduckgo.com&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt;), but Google&amp;rsquo;s will always work better. You can build your own social network but it won&amp;rsquo;t mean anything because people are already on Facebook (in fact, Google tried and failed). You can still go to any retailer and buy the same old products you see on Amazon, but nobody wants to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This much is clear enough. Where it gets really interesting is when you consider the nearly limitless scope of these changes, and the one most pertinent to the times is the impact of free distribution on politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, at least as long as parties have had votes for their presidential nominees, there has been an understanding that the selection of the nominee is somewhat democratic. In reality that was never the case. While the party base could vote to choose the nominee, they were really only picking one among a handful of candidates pre-selected by the party establishment. If you wanted to win an election, you needed the support of the establishment in securing donors and getting media coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time this changed was before the 2008 election when the preferred Democratic party nominee, Hilary Clinton, got sidelined by a newcomer that used the new media to garner a larger support among the base. Then Trump took that game to a whole new level in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense, this is the same pattern we&amp;rsquo;ve observed in multiple other consumer industries. The incumbent monopolies (the big political parties) held the choke point for reaching the masses. They controlled the supply (access to money, which then bought media). You could run for office on your own, but you weren&amp;rsquo;t gonna get very far. The parties' monopoly has now been subverted by the internet. Distribution is now free – anybody can reach the populace just as well as anyone else on social media – and what matters is who controls demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed in this light, the current political situation in the US is both unsurprising and an inevitability. Any expectation that we will go back to the good old days of &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; politics are foolish. The entire paradigm has shifted and new actors (no pun intended) who can navigate the new world are going to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like every distruption brought about by the internet, this will be a double-edged sword. While this disruption of the old order has led to some chaos (and will continue to do so until we figure out how to navigate the new paradigm skillfully), there is now &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; room for innovation in politics Admittedly, this may take some time. Personally, I don&amp;rsquo;t think Trump is going to be the final iteration of this change. When Facebook and Google disrupted old school mass advertising, they may have eaten the lunch of the old media, but they also made possible entire new industries that couldn&amp;rsquo;t have existed in the world of the old media. Today you can have successful Kickstarter campaigns that turn into new businesses with the support of a few tens or hundreds of thousands of people. In the old world, an ad campaign that only converted 20,000 customers would be an utter failure, given the cost of reaching them and distributing the goods to them. In the modern world, virtual mom-and-pop business can be started over night by targetting a narrow niche of just that size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major obstacle I see to this innovation is the marriage of politics to physical geography. On the internet, niche markets can be targetted because they&amp;rsquo;re not constrained by the physical world. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the answer is here (perhaps Peter Thiel&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/floating-city-plans-seasteading-institute-peter-thiel-blue-frontiers-2017-12#at-the-same-time-rising-sea-levels-due-to-climate-change-threaten-coastal-cities-around-the-world-building-a-floating-city-could-be-one-option-for-tackling-that-14&quot;&gt;floating cities&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;I had been taking dance lessons for several months and I was now getting into the difficult stuff. In this lesson, I had to learn to guide my partner’s head while softly holding the hands. It was not easy. As a beginner, I had watched experienced dancers do this many times before and it made perfect sense - like a mechanical inevitability. Reproducing it was a different story. I was doing my best to copy the shape I had observed the teacher make, but the technique required a much more intricate movement than what I could observe. Before I could do this movement, I had to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; how it worked rather than observe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a theme that comes up often when one is learning something new. To the non-practitioner, things either look too mysterious, magical, and overwhelming, or they look much simpler than they actually are. Rarely can the non-practitioner dissect the elements that make the end result great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this situation, there are two erroneous reaction that outside observers or novice practitioners have when they observe a master:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re overwhelmed by the master&amp;rsquo;s achievement and they can&amp;rsquo;t fathom the steps that would take them to the same level of mastery. This kind of thinking leads them to undue admiration of the master or simply giving up the pursuit in desperation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They attribute the overall success to one small component that they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; understand. This, in turn, leads them to either belittle the overall accomplishment by claiming that the one understandable component is not that special, or, if they are novice practitioners trying to reproduce the master’s result, they might focus on doing more of the thing they can understand. With time and attention, however, the practitioner’s field of vision expands to detect more of the nuance and the intricacies. Their attention during practice can then shift to the new areas that they’ve become aware of. This is how they can approach mastery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Imagine that a master chef begins using a rare ingredient in a new recipe. He does this because he understands how this ingredient interacts with all the others and the impact it might have, considering its place in the meal among the other courses. A less skilled chef who’s aspiring to be great may see this, and he may decide he wants to use the exact same ingredient. But since his understanding of the ingredient and its place in the big picture is not as comprehensive as the master’s, he might use this ingredient in a way that is jarring to his patron or not as well considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, a second type of error can occur in outside observers. Let’s say the less skilled chef is the first to pioneer this rare ingredient. While he might score some points for boldness, his output is still commensurate to his skill level. If the master chef then adopts this new ingredient in his own recipe, an untrained outside observer may fault him for being a copycat. The urge to do this among people who are not experts is particularly strong due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_poppy_syndrome&quot;&gt;tall poppy syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got thinking about this after the last product announcements from Apple. As they always do after an event like this, the detractors came out in droves to explain how Apple had built things that were available in Samsung products earlier. What these detractors miss is that the individual features that they’re focusing on are akin to ingredients in a recipe. We don’t set our expectations for a recipe solely on the basis of the ingredients used in them, but on the basis of who the chef is and their track record. A master chef can use an ingredient tastefully and to great effect. A mediocre one can use the same recipes indiscriminately and with poor results.&lt;/p&gt;

Listen to a critic who bases their judgement on bad heuristics and their commentary can cost you more than it helps.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Extreme Self-Responsibility</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/essays/2018/01/20/extreme-self-responsibility.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Extreme Self-Responsibility" /><published>2018-01-20T15:40:55+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-20T15:40:55+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/essays/2018/01/20/extreme-self-responsibility</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/essays/2018/01/20/extreme-self-responsibility.html">&lt;p&gt;One of the most impactful books I read in my early 20s was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79352.Six_Pillars_of_Self_Esteem&quot;&gt;The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem&lt;/a&gt; by clinical psychologist, Nathaniel Branden. It was a prescription for living a good life, long before I had learned about stoicism or meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- More --&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In Branden’s view self-esteem is our competence in life. It is the confidence that we can take on the challenges of life and be successful and that we are deserving of that success. Additionally, self-esteem doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It’s something that can be cultivated through deliberate practice, and it leads to a virtuous cycle: deliberate practice makes one more competent, the result of the competence increases one’s self-esteem, which makes the practice easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the core components of self-esteem is the practice of self-responsibility. Self-responsibility is the sense of control over one’s own life and actions. According to Branden, self-responsibility entails the following realizations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am responsible for the achievement of my desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am responsible for my choices and actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am responsible for the level of consciousness I bring to my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am responsible for the level of consciousness I bring to my relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am responsible for my behavior with other people – coworkers, associates, customers, spouse, children, friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am responsible for how I prioritize my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am responsible for the quality of my communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am responsible for my personal happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am responsible for accepting or choosing the values by which I live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am responsible for raising my self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the part of the book that stuck with me the most. It is an incredibly empowering concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we take this practice to an extreme?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When things don’t go our way, it is far too easy for our minds to construct elaborate excuses and find a scapegoat. This is when we begin to resent others, or hate the world/god for what it has done to us. We can avoid this trap if we simply take responsibility for… everything. Did I have a fight with a friend? I am responsible for that. Are things going poorly at work? I am responsible for that. Have I not achieved my goals? I am responsible for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But that’s impossible.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s more possible than you’d think. In talking to friends and family about this subject, I’ve found the main objection to the idea of extreme self-responsibility to be naive ideas around “fairness”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some adverse event occurs and we immediately lament that it was not fair that &lt;em&gt;it happened to us&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, what we can do is to a) try to pinpoint how our own actions led to that outcome, and b) see what we can do to alleviate the situation given that it has already occurred. This shifts the narrative from a sense of victimhood (“things are happening to me”) to a sense of empowerment (“I make things happen”). Being responsible for things and those things being fair are totally unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But I thought you went to a meditation retreat and are all about acceptance.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems living well is accepting what is outside of our control, and making an honest effort in improving that which is under our control. Extreme self-responsibility simply expands the domain of control. It is a mental hack to counteract our mind’s brilliance in taking the lazy way out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-responsibility does not mean that unfortunate events are &lt;em&gt;your fault&lt;/em&gt;. It means that regardless of whose fault it is, it is within your power to influence things that are important to you/your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, it may have been unfair that you had a mean math teacher in grade 10, who discouraged you from learning math for the rest of your life. But if you now deem math to be something helpful, you are responsible for overcoming that. Or it may be true that you had an unfortunate childhood that left you with many emotional baggages that make life harder now. But regardless, you are responsible for moving toward your goals and either overcome or work around those limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In psychology there is a concept called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control&quot;&gt;locus of control&lt;/a&gt;”. It measures how much people feel they have control over their own lives. People with an external locus of control are those who believe things happen &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; them. People with an internal locus of control are those who believe they can &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; things happen. Having an internal locus of control is associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moments-matter/201708/locus-control&quot;&gt;greater motivation&lt;/a&gt; and drive and higher resiliency in the face of adversity. (This why an internal locus of control is highly correlated with entrepreneurship). Having an external locus of control is associated with higher anxiety and &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1988-35828-001&quot;&gt;greater susceptibility to depression&lt;/a&gt;. Extreme self-responsibility is a practice for shifting one’s locus of control inward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I’d be remiss if I didn’t point out that this philosophy runs in total opposition to the currently prevalent culture of victimhood. Instead of raising responsible, high self-esteem kids that trust their own competence in life, so many schools and universities are running in the direction of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/opinion/sunday/judith-shulevitz-hiding-from-scary-ideas.html&quot;&gt;protecting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/03/24/someone-wrote-trump-2016-on-emorys-campus-in-chalk-some-students-said-they-no-longer-feel-safe/?utm_term=.714d88d65bbc&quot;&gt;everyone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/magazine/why-are-more-american-teenagers-than-ever-suffering-from-severe-anxiety.html&quot;&gt;against&lt;/a&gt; the most minute slight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This aversion to anything that may be remotely unpleasant  eliminates any sense of self-responsibility, and it raises impotent adults who are taught they’re unequipped to face the world as it is. In this way, victimhood culture worsens the lives of the very people it feigns compassion for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, let us put our own house in order first. Extreme self-responsibility is something I had lost focus on for a long time, and I wanted to write about it as a refresher. I’m trying to put a renewed focus on this going forward.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">One of the most impactful books I read in my early 20s was The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem by clinical psychologist, Nathaniel Branden.
