<meta name="description" content="I remember the first time I set foot inside a large bookstore. I was about 13 years old, and something had broken with my computer, which I needed to play games. My teacher at the time suggested I read a book on how to fix computers myself. When I entered the computer books section of Chapters, my mind was blown by the sheer number of books. Something clicked in my head and I thought: &ldquo;I need to read all of these!&rdquo; From that point on, I had an insatiable appetite for learning. The only exception to this were my university years – nothing can stifle a desire to learn like post-secondary education. I always imagined that given infinite resources and the ability to spend my time any way I wanted, I would just spend it learning and reading as much as I could. That notion is now deeply ingrained in my mind. But with age, I&rsquo;m realizing how misguided it is. The bottleneck to learning is not just time to read. It is time to apply. True learning is impossible without meaningful application. We don&rsquo;t learn through words but through all the senses. As the saying goes, &ldquo;the rudder only works when the ship is moving&rdquo; and building a large ship but never leaving port is simply a wasted investment. I&rsquo;ve always longed for the day when I can finally do nothing but learn. It&rsquo;s easy for us to construct visions of an ideal future where we&rsquo;ll be happier than now, and boundless time to read was (and is) a huge part of my utopian vision. But these visions are like dreams that don&rsquo;t make sense upon a second inspection, and if we cling to them for too long or believe them too much, we&rsquo;ll be unhappy when they (the impossible) are not realized. And if we do manage to achieve them, we&rsquo;ll find that while all the conditions of our dreams are met, the envisioned happiness is not to be found, and we&rsquo;ll repeat the cycle with a new vision. All of this means that the range of topics and skills that I can truly learn and apply is much more limited than what I imagined in my head. It also means that I&rsquo;m already living the life that I always wanted as much as is practical. If I was retired, the dials might get slightly tweaked and I may have a few extra hours per week to learn something or apply it. But life will not be radically different." />
