<p>There was a problem tho&hellip; I <em>learned</em> a LOT but <em>did</em> very LITTLE. After years of learning and reading many, many books, I had nothing to show for it. I never made a single usable program or app. I started a lot of them, but I never finished. The problem wasn&rsquo;t that I was wasting my time - I was doing better than could be expected of my age - the problem was that I didn&rsquo;t know what it was to be a maker of things, a producer. It was all about taking in other people&rsquo;s works. I found it interesting, but I never had the volition to make useful stuff out of the knowledge. I was just obsessed with accumulating knowledge.</p>

<p>Recently, I did become very concerned about how I spent my time. It was a few months ago where I kept catching myself checking Facebook and Twitter on my phone repeatedly. It got to a point where I&rsquo;d get kinda annoyed that people weren&rsquo;t posting interesting content fast enough to keep up with my pace of checking it. I was totally addicted to this external stimulus. It was time to change things up.</p>

<p>Step one was to delete all social media apps from my phone. I was checking all the apps at least once/minute because checking just one was usually not enough. So out went Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. But Buffer stayed - it&rsquo;s a one way channel where I can post things to social media without being innundated with endless feeds. After doing this, a period of annoyance followed, where I&rsquo;d keep getting my phone out of my pocket and realize there was no reason for me to do it. After 1-2 weeks, I had kicked the habit, and the phone sat firmly in pocket unless I wanted to contact someone.</p>

<p>After that little victory, I could clearly see my focus on my work improving - even though the impulse was still there and mildly distracting. I am now stepping it up a notch. I&rsquo;m using RescueTime to measure my own productivity week after week. I&rsquo;m actually considering paying for it to get more fine-grained data on my time in front of the computer.</p>

<p>Most importantly, however, I&rsquo;m slowly eliminating all other sources of consumption. I&rsquo;ve purged useless apps from my phone and most of the ones that remain have muted notifications. I have unsubscribed from various newsletters that clogged my inbox. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of projects I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do for a long time (including this blog). Now, when I have some spare time, I get working on one of these projects.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m kicking the consumer habit and trying to be a producer.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s extremely important to read books, but if I want to learn something about programming, instead of reading about it, I&rsquo;ll try making something. This is actually a much faster path to learning anyway - because it&rsquo;ll make it much more likely that you won&rsquo;t forget it and have to relearn it later.</p>

<p>Similarly, when I have a few spare minutes, instead of jumping on Twitter or Flipboard and clicking on random links, I write a blog post. I may not publish it, but it does get me in a producing mindset.</p>

<p>When I started doing this, it was only to get off of a habit that was clearly destructive. But the more I&rsquo;ve done this, the more clear it becomes to me that this different mindset is one of the core differences between successful entrepreneurs and&hellip; well&hellip; consumers. Taking on the producer mindset is taking on the habit of making a contribution to the world around you. If you&rsquo;re stuck in the cycle of consumption, making a meaningful contribution may seem like a distant idea. But if you&rsquo;ve produced something regularly, however small, you start realizing that you can have an impact on the world around you - or make a ding on the universe. Like all matters of the mind, the more you practice it the more you build momentum. So even if you&rsquo;re producing at a small, even insignificant, scale, you&rsquo;re preparing yourself for challenges that would otherwise be out of reach.</p>
